         <li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
     </ul>
     <h5> Teriyaki Sauce </h5>
     <ul>
         <li> 1/2 cup Teriyaki Sauce (such as Kikkoman) </li>
         <li> 1/2 cup water </li>
         <li> 1/4 white sugar </li>
         <li> 1/4 cup brown sugar, lightly packed </li>
         <li> Juice of 2 fresh orange wedges </li>
         <li> 1 1/2 TB cornstarch, fully dissolved in 1-2 TB water </li>
         <li> Dash of ground ginger </li>
         <li> Toasted sesame seeds </li>
     </ul>
     <h4> Steps </h4>
     <ol> 
         <li> Teriyaki Sauce: In a heavy medium pan, combine all sauce ingredients. Whisk to combine well. 
             Bring to a boil. Lower to simmer and whisk until sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Keep warm.</li>
        <li> Prep Salmon: thoroughly dry salmon fillets with paper towels. Sprinkle a light layer of kosher 
            salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides (or just top side, if bottom has skin on.)</li>    
        <li> Cook: lightly grease and heat outdoor grill (or indoor stovetop grill pan) until very hot (smoky.) 
            Lay salmon fillets on grill and cook on medium-high heat until just-cooked. Do not over-cook. Generally, 
            about 2-3 min per side, depending on thickness. Let cooked fish rest at room temp for a few minutes 
            before serving. </li>
         <li> Serve: drizzle generously with teriyaki sauce and garnish as desired. Serve immediately. 
             Delicious over a bed of rice or over a plate of green salad. </li>    

     </ol>
