<h3> Description </h3>
<p> This Spicy Thai Grilled Shrimp is simply irresistible.  The shrimp is absolutely succulent, tender, 
    and grilled to perfection in just 60 seconds. Thai style shrimp kebabs boast a nice kick (take down 
    the cayenne if you wish, but it’s sooo good the way it’s written.)  They’re sweet, tangy, and 100% 
    yum. 

    The super fast cook time is one of the great virtues of shrimp – it cooks in a blink, which makes 
    it equally great for busy weeknights and weekend gatherings.</p>
